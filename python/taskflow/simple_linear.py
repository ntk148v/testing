# INTRO: In this example we create two tasks, each of which ~calls~ a given
# ~phone~ number (provided as a function input) in a linear fashion (one after
# the other). For a workflow which is serial this shows a extremely simple way
# of structuring your tasks (the code that does the work) into a linear
# sequence (the flow) and then passing the work off to an engine, with some
# initial data to be ran in a reliable manner.
#
# NOTE(harlowja): This example shows a basic usage of the taskflow structures
# without involving the complexity of persistence. Using the structures that
# taskflow provides via tasks and flows makes it possible for you to easily at
# a later time hook in a persistence layer (and then gain the functionality
# that offers) when you decide the complexity of adding that layer in
# is 'worth it' for your application's usage pattern (which certain
# applications may not need).
